## Description

This app can help you plan out your daily activities.

## Usage Instructions

When you boot up the planner, you will notice that each section is highlighted in different colors. The gray section defines the hours that have already past. The red section is the current hour. The green section are the hours that are coming up. When you input text, it will be saved locally so when you refresh the page the text you put will reappear if you refresh the page.

## Learning Points

I was about to use Day.js to get the current time in the world onto my page and it will update by itself. Then I learned how to compare the current time to any given time and change the page to corrispond with what I want the change on the page. Like the changing of highlighted sections depending on the time of day.
